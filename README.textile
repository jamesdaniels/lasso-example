h2. Identity herding with OAuth

Lasso makes it damn easy to add SSO to your Rails application. Just load in your configuration, add a couple associations, and you are set to hit the trail running, partner.

This is an example Rails application demonstrating use of "Lasso":http://github.com/jamesdaniels/lasso and "Authlogic":http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic, which allows registration and identity claiming via OAuth.

"You can find more information on the Lasso gem here.":http://github.com/jamesdaniels/lasso
